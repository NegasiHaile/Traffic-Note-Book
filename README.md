# Project Name: Traffic-Note-Book

# Project Type: Web Application

# By: NEGASI HAILE

# Tech Stack: Vue: NuxtJS and Firebase

# Project target: Road Traffic violation recording notebook

# Actors: Administrators and traffics

## Administrator will give the authorization to traffics and they can access the applocation.
## And Traffics can use it as their notebook and more

This project is targeted at what traffics can do with the hard notebook they use to record violations and crimes. And instead of using that notebook, just they can have a digital one in this application and they can work everything simply and effectively.

## So what problems can solve this application?

## 1, Data losing: 
Suppose what will happen if traffic has lost his notebook, every data recorded in it will be lost forever. But with the digital one, once data is recorded it will not lose.

## 2, Data search: 
Data searching in a hard notebook is time-wasting & ineffective. Ex, if one traffic needs to know what a vehicle has previous records he has to search over all the pages. But with this application only typing the vehicle plate is expected and it will list all related records.

## 3, defiant expose: 
If a driver made a violation and try to escape, A traffic can expose him within a minute by writing the defiant vehicle identity then other traffics will be notified.
